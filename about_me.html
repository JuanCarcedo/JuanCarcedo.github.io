                Even though I enjoy programming and learning as a hobby, this is not the only thing I do.
                <br /><br />
                I studied a bit of price action and technical analysis of markets. I must say that it was enjoyable although risky! I did quite a few trades with 5-minute charts in the DAX, FTSE and the SP500.
                Also, I prepared myself for the Chartered Market Technician Level I, although Iâ€™ve never convinced my inner me to do the exam.
                <br /><br />
                In my free time I enjoy going to the Gym (in winter this task is hard), reading fantasy or science fiction or
                spending time at home with my wife and cat.
                <br /><br />
                I used to write (I finished 3 books) although lately I found myself engaged with other activities.
                Someday I may finalise the 4th book and try to publish them.
