Hello! This is my first website, I am trying to create a website where I can post simple programs.   
Included a test shop with bootstrap.  
Check it here: [Website](https://juancarcedo.github.io/)

## Code used  
HTML, CSS and a bit of JS.  
Bootstrap to do the shop.
  
Please, if you have any suggestions or improvements (better ways to do something) just let me know. I am more than happy to learn!  
Thank you!
